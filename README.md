## Bulgar things :
* FedEx, UPS, USPS: see if any carrier has any restrictions of snail-mailing picks. If you find any that do not disallow it, and local / remote government have no laws, you could use these to delivery your picks to the hotel you will stay. Make sure you have a reservation before you mail these, and include name on reservation and date of arrival on package so the front desk can hold the item for you. It would not hurt to inform the hotel of a package being sent, so you can get special instructions from them. Cost may be high -- might be cheaper to buy a set at con if you are looking at shipping a set.
* Flying? Put them in a checked bag. Carry-on runs risk of them being confiscated, forcing you to buy another set when you arrive, and lose the one you were bringing in -- double penalty.
* Don't try to hide the picks on your person is flying -- that looks really suspicious, and might increase risk of detention for, "questioning," just long enough for you to miss your flight. (Some officers can be jerks.)
* Buy at Con
* Find another place in Las Vegas to buy them.
* Buy online, bill at home, have picks delivered to hotel with your name and date of arrival, and any other info the hotel front desk suggests you leave on the package.
